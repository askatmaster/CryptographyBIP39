# CryptographyBIP39
Implementation of the BIP39 algorithm in C#

The original source for this project is: https://github.com/realindiahotel/BIP39.NET.

In my version of the project, i simply got rid of the BouncyCastle external library, retaining all the functionality and logic, added custom Russian Word List,
added class ```TestAlgoritm``` which represents the simplest implementation of the BIP39 principle to start understanding this topic.
